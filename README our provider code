Files changed and why

In our own files we updated our view to have a helper showGameOver() which
is called by the controller to notify/tell the view to display our game
over, which used to solely be handled in the controller. We also had a
problem with our observers/set controller methods. We used to have them be
two separate things but then merged them together to properly be called
throughout our program, we ket the overall design and naming convention the
same. One of our customers pointed out these issues which helped them and
also improved our code.

//had to add getters for adaptation


Our providers had to change their code to include necessary interfaces for
classes, their lists also take in their class CardGame instead of their
interface Card, which messes with both of our programs.
